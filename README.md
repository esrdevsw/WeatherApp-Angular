This is an Angular full stack weather app with Angular CLI 14.2.7 and we use a public API from RapidAPI.COM to get live weather forecast values for the searched city.
When we run a new search, we get the update for the current weather conditions and the background image 'is updated with the temperature variation with a javascript function.
